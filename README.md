## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the enquiries)
- **Bonus**: Add your own details (image, skills, projects) to replace the ones in the design

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript DOM manipulation

### What I learned

In this project, I learned the importance of planning before writing code. By taking the time to properly plan out the project, I was able to visualize the overall structure and layout of the project, which helped me to better understand the positioning of elements and DOM manipulation. I also came to realize that by planning in advance, I can write more efficient and organized code, which can lead to a smoother development process and a better end result. Overall, this experience reinforced the value of taking the time to plan and think through a project before diving into the actual development.

### Continued development

I plan to focus on writing more efficient code, tackling more complex projects that involve more logic, and staying current with the latest industry trends and developments. I will achieve this by experimenting with new techniques, tools, and frameworks to optimize my code.
